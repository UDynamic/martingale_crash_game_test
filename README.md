# martingale_crash_game_test
This repo simulates the classic **Martingale betting strategy** within a **rising index "Crash" game** environment.  **Crash games** (e.g. Aviator, Bustabit) tempt players with the illusion of beatable odds. Martingale tempts them with the illusion of recovery. This repo throws both illusions into a Python blender and lets you watch them explode.
